                <p>I currently reside in Matthews, North Carolina with my wife and 6 yr old twins. I have been in and around the IT industry about 13 years. I have worked at tech
                            giants such as Microsoft and ESPN along with consulting to many local businesses.I am currently employeed at Comporium, a local Internet, Telephone, and Cable provider. Focusing on infrastructure and server administration for most of my career, I have become 
                            well versed in automating procedures, security with PKI and authentication protocols along with LDAP, messenging, file systems, scripting and virtualization. I have had 
                            my share of differences of opinions with developers where we can't come together on why an application is performing poorly; is it the hardware or the code? I have 
                            decided to learn the code and get the answer definitively. This is the beginning of my journey into becoming a turn-key engineer, one who can develop your app and 
                            architect, deploy and administer the back-end infrastructure on which its hosted.
