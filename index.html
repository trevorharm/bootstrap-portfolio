                        <p>I currently reside in Matthews, North Carolina with my wife and 6 yr old 
                            twins. I have been in and around the IT industry about 13 years. I have 
                            worked at tech giants such as Microsoft and ESPN along with consulting to 
                            many local businesses.I am currently employeed at Comporium, a local 
                            Internet, Telephone, and Cable provider. Focusing on infrastructure and 
                            server administration for most of my career, I have become well versed in 
                            automating procedures, security with PKI and authentication protocols along 
                            with LDAP, messaging, file systems, scripting and virtualization. I have had 
                            my share of differences of opinions with developers where we can't come 
                            together on why an application is performing poorly; is it the hardware or the code? 
                            I have decided to learn the code and get the answer definitively. This is 
                            the beginning of my journey into becoming a turn-key engineer, one who can 
                            develop your app and architect, deploy and administer the back-end 
                            infrastructure on which its hosted.
